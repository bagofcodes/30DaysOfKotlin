# 30DaysOfkotlin

This is my first project while learning Kotlin.This project is an implementation of Kotlin programming language to build an App(i.e A simple Calculator).
This App might seem simple but incorporates many concepts which helped me learn and become more familiar towards this language.

## Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to setup and run this project on your system.

### Prerequisites

This project needs the following packages to be installed to run.

```
1) Gradle Build System (3.6.3)
2) Android SDK (API 21)
```

And you need either a AVD or a physical android device of API 21 and above to run this project on.

### Installing and Running

I strongly suggest to use Android Studio for running this project as it's a pretty good IDE for Android
Development. Also It takes care of most of the dependency installation by itself with minimal user
interaction.

1. Make sure you have git installed. Go to [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/) to install it.
2. Open the terminal.
3. Type in "git clone https://github.com/bagofcodes/30DaysOfkotlin.git to clone this repository.
4. Open the project in Android Studio (preferably version 3.x).
5. Perform a Gradle sync (click on 'Sync now' in the popup).
6. Build and Run the project.
